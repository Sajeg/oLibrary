# oLibrary

This project aims to be a feature rich way to search through the books of the [Stadtbibliothek Oldenburg](https://www.stadtbibliothek.oldenburg.de)

[oLibrary-db-updater](https://github.com/Sajeg/olibrary-db-updater/) is the backend the updates the catalog that the app then uses to search.

## Download
At the moment I don't provide a downloadble apk, so to try it out for yourself you need to download and compile it.
